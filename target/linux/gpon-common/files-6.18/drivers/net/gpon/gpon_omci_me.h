 * TIER: CORE (prefix gpon_) — decides, never touches hardware, and compiles for

 * TIERS" in gpon_common.h (this directory).
 *
 * gpon_omci_me.h — the ITU-T G.988 MANAGED-ENTITY model and MIB store: which
 * managed entities this ONU holds and what their attribute bytes are.  Three
 * things, and nothing else: the TABLE-DRIVEN attribute descriptors (one row per
 * class+attribute) with the one generic filler that walks them; the STATIC
 * MIB-Upload row table; and the DYNAMIC store of the instances the OLT itself
 * created, plus the context struct that holds all of it.
 *
 * It does NOT parse a PDU, dispatch a message type, build an envelope, stamp a
 * trailer or compute a MIC — that is gpon_omci_core.{h,c}, which CALLS this
 * one.  G.988 message rules are identical on every ONU ever built; the set of
 * MEs a product serves is a property of the PRODUCT.
 *
 * Table-driven is a FOOTPRINT decision (<=64 MB RAM, small NAND) and it makes
 * three cross-vendor invariants STRUCTURAL rather than per-case: every reply
 * bounded by the Get value area; the attribute set of an ME derivable, so a Get
 * NAMES what it does not support and what did not fit instead of answering
 * success with a short mask and generating OLT re-GET churn; and one policy per
 * vendor-reserved class RANGE instead of a list of the class IDs one OLT asked
 * for.
 *
 * ⚠ realtek-luna does NOT compile this yet: it carries a third, independently
 *   written model in rtl9602c_eth.c on file-scope globals, with a different
 *   identity and a different ME 7 / ME 11 attribute set.  Pointing Luna here
 *   CHANGES LUNA'S EMITTED BYTES, so it needs its own board gate (F1/F2/F3).
 *   Nothing here was altered to accommodate it.
 *
 * ENDIANNESS: every attribute value is emitted big-endian by explicit byte math
 * (omci_attr_bytes() in the .c), never a cast over wire bytes.
