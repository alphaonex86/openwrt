/*
 * SFF-8472 A2h digital-diagnostic-monitoring (DDM) decode + integer scaling for
 * the GPON BOSA optical monitor (Realtek RTL9607F "Elnath").
 *
 * FUNCTIONAL CORE: pure functions only.  No MMIO, no i2c, no kernel API beyond
 * the integer types, no floating point.  The imperative shell that actually
 * drives the bus lives in cortina-gpon-bosa.c; keeping the decode separate is
 * what lets the scaling + the "unavailable" policy be unit-tested on the x86
 * host instead of on a board (project rule: prove it offline first).
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The register map, and the evidence for it
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * The BOSA answers at i2c slave 0x51, i.e. the SFF-8472 "A2h" diagnostic
 * address (0xA2 >> 1).  Three independent facts from this board say the device
 * really does implement the standard A2h layout, not just the address:
 *
 *   - the stock bring-up trace (tier 2: this board's own captured on-wire
 *     rtkbosa sequence, replayed verbatim in cortina-gpon-bosa-seq.h) writes
 *     un-paged registers 0x00-0x4F and then ONLY 0x6E, 0x6F, 0x72, 0x78, 0x79,
 *     0x7B-0x7E and 0x7F.  0x00-0x37 is exactly the A2h alarm/warning
 *     THRESHOLD block (bytes 0-55) and 0x38-0x4F the calibration-constant
 *     block (bytes 56-79) -- precisely what a host programs on an A2h device;
 *   - register 0x6E bit6 is the laser soft-disable the existing code already
 *     uses (BOSA_REG_TX_CTL / BOSA_TX_SOFT_DIS), which is SFF-8472 byte 110
 *     "Status/Control" bit 6 "Soft TX Disable" -- an exact field match;
 *   - register 0x7F is the table/page select for the 0x80-0xFF window, which is
 *     SFF-8472 byte 127 "page select" -- a second exact field match.
 *
 * Regs 0x60-0x69 (bytes 96-105) are the real-time diagnostics.  They are LIVE,
 * not part of the programmed image: the stock write trace contains ZERO writes
 * to them, and their values drift between reads seconds apart.  They sit in the
 * UN-PAGED 0x00-0x7F window, so reading them needs no page dance and must never
 * touch the table-select register 0x7F.
 *
 * The optic is factory-calibrated internally (the stock rtkbosa carries
 * gn28l95_ddmi_k_* / gn28l95_is_calibrated helpers), so the words below are
 * already-calibrated readings: do NOT apply a host-side calibration polynomial
 * and do NOT add a per-board constant.
 *
 * Scaling (SFF-8472 table 9-11; the four non-RX fields cross-checked against
 * decoded stock dumps of this very module, tier 2):
 *
 *   0x60-61  temperature   s16, 1/256 degC     raw 0x265b -> 38.36 degC
 *   0x62-63  Vcc           u16, 100 uV         raw 0x7e24 -> 3.229 V
 *   0x64-65  TX bias       u16, 2 uA           raw 0x1d7e -> 15.10 mA
 *   0x66-67  TX power      u16, 0.1 uW         raw 0x432d -> +2.35 dBm
 *   0x68-69  RX power      u16, 0.1 uW         raw 0x1652 -> -2.43 dBm
 *
 * On the 0.1 uW LSB: SFF-8472 specifies the same unit for TX and RX power, and
 * TX is decisive -- at a 0.01 uW LSB the stock TX reading would be -7.65 dBm,
 * impossible for a GPON class-B+ transmitter (roughly +0.5..+5 dBm), while
 * 0.1 uW gives +2.35 dBm.  So 0.1 uW is used for both, as the standard says.
 * The resulting RX of -2.43 dBm is above the nominal class-B+ overload point
 * (~-8 dBm); that is consistent with this lab rig being a short patch cord with
 * no attenuator, i.e. the link is hot rather than the scaling being wrong.  The
 * RAW word is exported unconditionally either way, so a reader can re-scale
 * without a firmware change.  The direct oracle for RX specifically is the
 * ONU-reported RX field in the OLT's optical view, or a stock NAND boot reading
 * these same registers with the vendor's own scaling -- NOT the OLT's
 * "show ont-info" received power, which validates our TX.
