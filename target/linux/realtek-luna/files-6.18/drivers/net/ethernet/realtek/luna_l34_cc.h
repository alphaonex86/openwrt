 * luna_l34_cc.h - the FLOWBASED dies' flow-cache COMMAND BLOCK, at family tier
 *
 * `luna_l34_acc.h` says what a FLOWBASED die owes -- an allocator, a 32-byte
 * packer, a coherent publish and an invalidate command -- and that it does NOT
 * owe a row in the indirect-access table.  This is the command half of that,
 * and it is family tier because BOTH dies measured carry the same 18 registers
 * at the same 18 offsets: a third FLOWBASED die costs a check, not a table.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-09-16 from the G24W's own vendor kernel (tier 2), walked from
 * each die's OWN register list at two different index bases, so the agreement
 * is not one list read twice.  Account, with the disassembly:
 * dev/re-tools/FINDING-flowbased-ddr-publish-path-2026-09-16.md
 *
 * ⚠ THE OPTION BITS' POSITIONS ARE ESTABLISHED AND THEIR MEANING IS NOT.  The
 * vendor's field-name strings are not shipped.  Only the two command shapes the
 * vendor actually issues are expressed here; a third must be measured first.
