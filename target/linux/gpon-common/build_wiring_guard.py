"""build_wiring_guard.py -- offline proof that the SHARED GPON files- tree is
actually wired into BOTH OpenWrt targets, and wired the only way that works.

WHAT THIS IS
  A no-device, no-build guard over the build wiring of the common GPON layer:
  target/linux/gpon-common/files-<ver>/drivers/net/gpon/.  It reads Makefiles
  and Kconfigs and asserts the handful of invariants whose violation is SILENT
  -- the ones a green build would not reveal.

WHY IT IS COMMON -- and which targets it covers
  Operator, 2026-08-05: "la idea es poner en comun el codigo que corresponde
  para no tener mucho duplicado", and on the two per-target monoliths carrying
  a private protocol copy each: "mal, poner en comun".  The shared tree is
  compiled by realtek-luna (MIPS32, big-endian) and realtek-elnath (aarch64,
  little-endian) from ONE authored copy; this guard is what proves the "one
  copy, two targets" claim instead of asserting it.

THE CORE/SHELL RULE IT OBEYS
  It is a build-wiring guard, not a driver: it touches no device, opens no
  register and never runs on the board.  Nothing it checks may ever require
  hardware, and no file it guards may ever gain an MMIO access -- that second
  half is proven separately by gpon_core_purity_test in dev/rtl9607c-test/.

  Run it with --self-check to see every assertion FAIL on a mutated scratch
  copy.  A guard whose removal leaves the gate green is not a guard.
