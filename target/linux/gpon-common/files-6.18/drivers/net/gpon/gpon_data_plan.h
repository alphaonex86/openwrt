 * TIER: CORE (prefix gpon_) — decides, never touches hardware, and compiles for
 * MIPS-BE, ARM64-LE and x86.  Canonical tier rule: see "THE THREE TIERS" in
 * gpon_common.h (this directory).
 *
 * gpon_data_plan.h — "is what is ARMED still what the OLT WANTS?", answered
 * once instead of three times.
 *
 * ★★★ THE SAME QUESTION WAS ANSWERED IN THREE PLACES, EACH COVERING A DIFFERENT
 *     SUBSET, AND NONE COULD CALL ANOTHER (measured 2026-09-04): the core's own
 *     re-arm notices only the GEM MOVING; Luna's stale-clear fires only on an
 *     explicit OLT Deallocate, so a REASSIGNMENT without one is invisible to
 *     it; the Cortina shell is the widest and the only one carrying both
 *     clauses below.  G.984.3 lets the OLT reassign an Alloc-ID or a GEM
 *     Port-ID at any time, so an ONU that latches "installed" and never re-asks
 *     bursts a stale GEM into a grant slot that now belongs to somebody else.
 *     WHICH REGISTERS hold the binding is silicon; WHETHER IT IS STILL RIGHT is
 *     protocol.
 *
 * ★ THE TWO CLAUSES THAT EXIST IN NEITHER OTHER COPY — the reason this file is
 *   not just a rename:
 *   (a) THE ALLOC MOVED WITH THE GEM UNCHANGED.  An OLT that re-provisions ME
 *       262 onto a different Alloc-ID while keeping ME 268 leaves the T-CONT
 *       CAM pointing at an Alloc-ID the OLT no longer grants: upstream simply
 *       stops, with every shadow reading healthy.
 *   (b) THE RIDE PREMISE WAS LOST.  On a single-alloc OLT the data path is
 *       installed on the OMCC's own T-CONT because the data Alloc-ID WAS the
 *       OMCC's.  If the OLT then moves the OMCC mid-O5 that premise is gone and
 *       user traffic silently follows whatever Alloc-ID the OMCC moved to.
 *       Neither {alloc, gem} comparison can see this: neither value changed.
 *
 * ★ IT DECIDES AND NEVER DOES, and does not even ASK for a teardown through an
 *   op table: the upstream teardown ORDER is a hardware requirement (drain the
 *   VoQs first), and the tree contains ZERO instances of struct gpon_shell_ops
 *   (checked 2026-09-04).  Everything below is a PURE VERDICT.
 *
 * ★ HEADER-ONLY, ON PURPOSE — static inline, so no Makefile line and no object.
 *   ⚠ THE CONSEQUENCE: the strict-subset host-build gate walks a list of .c
 *   files and does NOT reach this header.  Its host-build coverage is
 *   dev/rtl9607c-test/gpon_data_plan_diff_test.c, which includes and compiles
 *   it on x86 -- that binary IS the purity proof, and deleting it removes one.
 *
 * ★ THE HONEST CAVEAT: the RECONCILE half is the load-bearing one.  The UNDO
 *   half has ONE consumer today (Luna has no data teardown at all), so its
 *   value is preventing a future re-derivation, not deduplicating a copy.

 *     every one of 109 messages rc=0 including the ME 262 Set that assigns
 *     Alloc-ID 0x0100, and ~2 s later it DEACTIVATES us -- while `data_owner`
 *     reads `admitted=0 alloc_bound=0`.  Nothing in the driver could say WHICH
 *     precondition was missing, so nothing could distinguish "the OLT never
 *     authorised this Alloc-ID over PLOAM" from "the OMCC transport is down"
 *     from "ME 268 never named a GEM port" -- three different faults wearing
 *     one word.
 *
 * ⚠ THE ORDER HERE MIRRORS `gpon_data_plan_decide` DELIBERATELY, and a
 *   differential pins that: for every input, this returns NONE exactly when the
 *   plan is KEEP, INSTALL or REPLACE.  A blocker that disagreed with the
