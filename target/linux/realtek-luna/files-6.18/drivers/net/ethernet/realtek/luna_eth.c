/*
 * Realtek Luna (MIPS interAptiv) GMAC0 + on-chip switch -- eth0.
 *
 * Clean-room driver for the SoC's CPU-port Gigabit MAC (the "GMAC0" engine at
 * phys 0x18012000) and a minimal open-L2 bring-up of the on-chip switch core
 * (phys 0x1b000000). The CPU reaches the LAN only through the switch:
 *
 *	CPU <-> GMAC0 (eth0) <-> switch CPU-port <-> physical LAN port <-> wire
 *
 * It serves TWO chips, so it carries the FAMILY name; the chip-specific half is
 * a TABLE (struct luna_eth_chip), never an #ifdef and never a second copy of
 * the file -- a duplicated driver is how a repair lands on one board only.
 *
 *	RTL9607C   engineering board, 11 switch ports, 3 CPU GMACs, SerDes uplink
 *	RTL9603CVD LANLY G24W,         6 switch ports, 1 CPU GMAC,  no SerDes
 *
 * The MAC engine is identical on both; the SWITCH registers are not. Of 1361
 * name-matched switch registers, 853 keep their offset and 508 MOVE [tier 3,
 * each chip's own SDK]. The trap that pays for the table: the RTL9607C's
 * P_ABLTY at 0x200 is SDS_CFG on the RTL9603CVD, so a driver that "just worked
 * because the family is the same" would read a SerDes configuration word and
 * call it a link state.
 *
 * Switch bring-up facts, established on the RTL9607C:
 *  - The LOAD-BEARING RX GATE is the per-port spanning-tree state (MSTI_CTRL).
 *    SRC_PORT_PERMIT was blamed alongside it and that reading is REFUTED on
 *    both measurable dies; the field has ONE statement and it is
 *    luna_eth_regs.h's @src_permit.  Do not restate it here.
 *  - MSTI_CTRL resets to 0x000000FF on BOTH chips, every port FORWARDING. Ports
 *    found non-forwarding at probe are the BOOT LOADER's doing, so the write
 *    below is a correction and must stay even if a future loader stops needing
 *    it.
 *  - The integrated copper PHYs need no analog calibration on either chip.
 *  - The ordered sequence matters: replaying only the final register values is
 *    not sufficient on this hardware.
