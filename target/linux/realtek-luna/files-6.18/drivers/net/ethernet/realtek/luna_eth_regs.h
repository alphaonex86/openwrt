 * Register facts for the Ethernet MAC and switch core on the Realtek Luna
 * family (RTL9602C, RTL9603CVD, and the siblings that follow).
 *
 * ★ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, AND WHAT IT MEASURED.  The family had TWO Ethernet
 * drivers -- rtl9602c_eth.c for the X111W and luna_eth.c for the G24W --
 * each carrying its own copy of the register map.  Compared symbol by symbol on
 * 2026-08-28, with the comments stripped so that a re-worded comment could not
 * masquerade as a different value:
 *
 *     34 symbols  IDENTICAL on both chips   -> family facts, and they live here
 *      4 symbols  genuinely per-chip        -> struct luna_sw_map, below
 *
 * That ratio is the argument for the whole port strategy: a new Luna board owes
 * a TABLE, not a driver.  Two copies of 34 agreeing constants is not redundancy,
 * it is two chances to edit one of them.
 *
 * ★★ THE PER-CHIP FOUR ARE NOT A MISTAKE, AND THEY ARE THE DANGEROUS KIND.
 * The switch LUT block MOVED between the two silicon revisions: the RTL9603CVD
 * inserted registers, so everything from LUT_UNKN_UC_DA_CTRL onward shifted.
 * Confirmed on 2026-08-28 from each chip's OWN chipdef in the vendor SDK, which
 * agrees with what both drivers already had -- two independent tiers:
 *
 *     register              rtl9602c   rtl9603cvd
 *     LUT_UNKN_SA_CTRL       0x1C004     0x1C004    (unmoved)
 *     LUT_UNKN_UC_DA_CTRL    0x1C008     0x1C00C    (+4)
 *     UNKN_L2_MC             0x1C010     0x1C018    (+8)
 *     UNKN_IP4_MC            0x1C014     0x1C01C    (+8)
 *     UNKN_IP6_MC            0x1C018     0x1C020    (+8)
 *     LUT_BC_FLOOD           0x1C020     0x1C028    (+8)
 *     LUT_UNKN_MC_FLOOD      0x1C024     0x1C02C    (+8)
 *     LUT_UNKN_UC_FLOOD      0x1C028     0x1C030    (+8)
 *
 * ⚠ READ THE FIRST AND LAST ROWS TOGETHER: the 9602C's LUT_UNKN_UC_FLOOD and
 * the 9603CVD's LUT_BC_FLOOD are BOTH 0x1C028.  Using one chip's constant on
 * the other's silicon does not fault and does not read back wrong -- it
 * configures unicast flooding when broadcast flooding was meant.  That is the
 * same shape as the CFG_PHY_CTRL defect that cost this project weeks, and it is
 * exactly why these four are a table and not a #define.

 *   the shape this family header exists to end.

 * left to put back.  A refill that fails AFTER that point therefore cannot
 * "retry next poll": it leaves skbs[idx] pointing at memory the driver no
 * longer owns, behind a descriptor whose D_OWN is clear -- so the next poll
 * walks straight past the ownership guard and re-delivers a freed skb (and
 * unmaps the same address a second time, which fires first).
 *
 * ⇒ CALL THIS BEFORE CONSUMING THE FRAME, and on NULL drop the frame with
 * luna_rx_rearm() instead.  Never NULL out skbs[idx] as a shortcut: the loops
 * have no !skb guard, so that converts the use-after-free into a NULL deref
