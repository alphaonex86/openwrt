 *
 *   valid 1024-byte file                      -> 1024            (right)
 *   newer metadata node with isize = 0        -> the OLD 1024     (wrong)
 *   deliberate data-CRC mismatch              -> the CORRUPT 1024 (wrong)
 *   newest fragment, good CRC, invalid zlib   -> the OLD 1024     (wrong)
 *
 * ⇒ an "exactly 1024 bytes came back" check could not tell fresh from stale nor
 *   sound from corrupt, and the GN25L95 calibration contract requires exactly
 *   1024 VALIDATED bytes before a single laser register is written. Programming
 *   a laser from silently stale calibration is the failure this prevents.
 *
 * ★ THE FOUR REPAIRS: header/node/data CRCs are verified; `isize` of the
 *   highest version decides the length, so a truncation SHRINKS the file; every
 *   read is bounded inside its own node and inside the image; and a node we
 *   cannot decode is an ERROR, never a silent skip back to older bytes.
 *
 * ⚠ AN EMPTY FILE IS NOT CORRUPTION. A valid latest node with isize = 0 returns
 *   0, faithfully -- it is the CONSUMER that says "0 is not 1024 bytes of
 *   calibration". Forcing this generic reader to call every empty file corrupt
 *   would put a policy of one caller into a routine several callers share.
