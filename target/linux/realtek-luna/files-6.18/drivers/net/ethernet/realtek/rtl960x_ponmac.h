 * rtl960x_ponmac.h - board-agnostic bring-up of the Realtek RTL960x family
 * GPON PON-MAC / SerDes, matching the stock device's register behavior.
 *
 * Purpose: have a stock-faithful ponmac/SerDes bring-up for the WHOLE
 * RTL960x family in-tree, so any future 960x board can be brought online by
 * wiring its register accessor + chip id, without re-deriving the sequence
 * from scratch.
 *
 * Reconstructed per-chip from the stock register behavior, with every register
 * resolved to its ABSOLUTE physical address from that chip's register map and
 * field bit-ranges from its field map. The 9602C path is HW-tested (the
 * realtek-luna board); the other family members are behavior-faithful
 * transcriptions, untested for lack of hardware, ready for when a board is
 * connected.
 *
 * The bring-up uses ABSOLUTE physical register addresses; the board driver
 * supplies rd/wr that map phys->virt (KSEG1 0xa0000000|phys, or ioremap).
 * On the 9602C "Luna" SoC: swcore phys 0x1b000000, PON-IP 0x1bf00000,
 * GTC 0x1b700000 (all in the KSEG1-reachable 0x1bxxxxxx window).

 * it is driven by target/linux/realtek-elnath.  It used to sit in this enum
 * as a placeholder returning -ENOTSUPP, which made the file look like it
 * covered the whole RTL960x number space while serving one half of it.
