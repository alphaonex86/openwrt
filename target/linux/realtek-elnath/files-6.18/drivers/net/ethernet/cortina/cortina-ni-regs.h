 * ★★★ THE COMMENT-TO-REGISTER RATIO HERE IS DELIBERATE.  DO NOT "CLEAN IT UP".
 *
 * Measured 2026-08-29: 909 defines, ~1500 comment lines, 259 comment blocks.
 * That looks like bloat and it was nearly cut on exactly that reading.  What
 * those lines actually hold:
 *
 *   68 blocks (602 lines) carry a TIER, a DATE, a build/bisect id, or an
 *      explicit REFUTATION -- e.g. the CLS monitor's enable is BIT(8) and an
 *      earlier probe used bit0, so "every conclusion drawn from cls_hit all 0
 *      is VOID"; or the TX MIB block's "UNVALIDATED - DO NOT USE AS A WITNESS",
 *      with the measurement that refuted it (1164 frames, every cell moved by
 *      ZERO).  Deleting those lets the same wrong conclusion be drawn twice.
 *
 *   77 blocks (657 lines) carry no such marker and are still not decoration:
 *      they are pipeline maps and root causes -- the four L2FE profile tables
 *      consulted BEFORE the forwarding decision, or why the GPHY firmware must
 *      be seeded before a single frame crosses (until it is, the LINE side
 *      negotiates and reports link while nothing forwards).
 *
 *   114 blocks (236 lines) are one-to-four-line field notes, which is simply
 *      what a register header is for.
 *
 * ⇒ what IS removable here is DEAD DEFINES, and 106 of them were removed the
 *   same day.  The prose is the reason a clean-room register map can be trusted
 *   at all: a value without its why is an assertion, and a refuted witness that
 *   nobody recorded gets re-chased.

 * Two register files are involved:
 *
 *  1. The NI core window (DT idx 0).  The RTL9607F NI_HV block was
 *     re-generated vs. the public CA8277B map: identical bit layouts but the
 *     block moved from +0x4xxx to +0xaxxx and the per-port stride shrank
 *     from 0xa0 to 0x90.  All offsets below were re-verified per-function in
 *     the shipped RTL9607F firmware (ca-ne.ko disassembly: aal_ni_reset_intf,
 *     aal_ni_eth_port_mac_set, aal_ni_mac_autosync_cfg_set).  The L2TM block
 *     (+0x2xxx) is unchanged from CA8277B (verified: aal_l2_tm_es_ena_set
 *     uses +0x2300, aal_l2_qm_eq_cfg_set +0x2208, aal_l2_qm_buff_cfg_set
 *     +0x2210).
 *
 *  2. The DMA-LSO window (DT idx 4, 4K).  This block matches the public
 *     CA8277B register file; everything here is window-relative (the stock
 *     accessor is base + (phys - 0xf7001000)).

 * DMA-AFT ("DMA After") - the HARDWARE VLAN/PPPoE egress header edit.
 *
 * This is where stock puts the WAN VLAN tag, and stock names the engine
 * itself: fc_mgr.ko logs "force disable hw vlan/pppoe offload for this
 * case with AFT Map idx %d" when it runs out of map entries.
 *
 * ★ THE FIELD THAT MISLED US FOR A DAY: vlan_vld does NOT mean "valid".
 * The vendor decoder's own legend is
 *     vlan_vld: (0: VLAN stacking operation mode, 1: VLAN set mode)
 *     vlan_cnt: (redefined as TOP_VLAN_CMD[1:0] under stacking mode)
 * so in SET mode vlan_cnt is the number of tags the EGRESS frame carries.
 * An entry reading "vlan_vld 1, vlan_cnt 0, top_vid 0" is therefore a
 * correctly programmed VLAN *STRIP* - which is exactly what the DOWNSTREAM
 * leg of a tagged WAN must do - NOT an empty entry.  Reading it as "enabled
 * and empty" is what wrongly excluded this table on 2026-08-04.
 *
 * Two tables, indirect, both inside the already-mapped 4K CA_NI_WIN_DMA
 * window at 0x4_f7001000 (so no new ioremap):
 *   MAP   [lspid]  -> fib_id      (which edit applies to frames from lspid)
 *   L2FIB [fib_id] -> the edit    (top/inner VID, TPID sel, PPPoE session)
 *
 * Offsets and field positions recovered from the stock binaries, and every
 * one of them agrees across TWO independent modules:
 *   ca-ne.ko  aal_ni_dma_lso_set_aft_l2fib      - the raw table writer
 *   ca-ne.ko  aal_ni_set_dma_lso_aft_l2fib_*    - one setter per field
 *   ca-ne.ko  aal_ni_dma_lso_set_dmaaft_map_tbl - the map writer
 *   fc_mgr.ko rtk_9607f_asic_dmaAftFib_set      - the struct serialiser,
 *             independently emitting top_vid with the SAME `bfi #0x13,#0xc`
 *   fc_mgr.ko rtk_9607f_asic_dmaAftTpid_set     - the 4 TPID slots
 * The ACCESS address derived this way (0x4f7001f38) is the one already
 * measured live on the board, which is the third agreeing tier.

 * about, and the hardware accepts a write to the wrong address without
 * complaint.  Sanitizers do not help either -- these are MMIO writes through an
 * ioremapped window, so there is no allocation for ASan to bound-check and
 * valgrind does not run kernel code.
 *
 * So the map guards itself.  CA_NI_IDX() is the bound check for the one pattern
 * that actually goes wrong: an indexed write inside a loop.  Under
 * CONFIG_CORTINA_NI_REG_GUARD it warns once, naming the array and the index, if
 * the index is past the array's declared entry count; with the option off it
 * compiles to the plain macro expansion and costs nothing.
 *
 * It exists because CA_NI_QM_DEST_PORT_EQ_CFG was written sixteen entries past
 * its 32-entry table -- the loop was bounded by CA_NI_QM_DEST_PORT_MAX (0x2f),
 * which is the dest-port NUMBER SPACE and not the table length -- and the
 * overshoot landed on EQ_PROFILE_GLOBAL(0..2).  It was invisible while both
 * writes happened to store the same value.  A static guard in the host suite
 * catches the declared case; this catches the one a static check cannot: an
 * index that only goes out of range at runtime.

 * ★★ L3FE GLOBAL DEBUG / MONITOR block - RESOLVED 2026-07-25, tier-2 (stock
 * ca-ne.ko aal_l3fe_glb_cls_stg_monitor_get / _dbg_get / _dbg_latch_*)
 * corroborated field-for-field by the vendor sibling header.  Two indirect
 * READ ports {index, data} plus a one-shot descriptor latch:
 *   0x30b0 CLS-monitor index: BIT(8) ENABLE | (vector << 5) | word   ★ the
 *          enable is BIT(8) - an earlier probe used bit0, so the monitor was
 *          never enabled and its "cls_hit[0..3]" output was meaningless; every
 *          conclusion drawn from "cls_hit all 0" is VOID.  Up to 32 words, not 4.
 *   0x30b4 CLS-monitor DATA (read-only)
 *   0x30b8 DBG index: (vector << 5) | word, vector 0..31; no enable bit
 *   0x30bc DBG DATA (read-only).  Vector 15 = four 10-bit per-stage packet
 *          counters {L3FE_IN, L3FE_OUT, T1_T2, STG3_PE} = the real
 *          "frame entered the engine" witness, unlike the NI_HV gauges.
 *   0x30c0 latch trigger: BIT(1) mode, BIT(0) = an ARM TOGGLE (one capture per
 *          flip).  0x30c4 latch index (vector << 5 | word), 0x30c8 latch DATA.
 *          Vector 2 = HDR_I before the packet editor (all lookups resolved:
 *          carries the engine's own key CRC32/CRC16, hash_idx, hash_profile,
 *          the CLS hit class and hash_dbl_chk_fail).
 * ★ The UNLATCHED taps are a read-mux over live pipeline shadow registers, so
 * words of one dump can come from DIFFERENT packets (the vendor says so
 * explicitly) - gauges, never coherent snapshots.  Use the latch for anything
 * that compares fields of one frame.
 *
 * ★★ CONFLICT RESOLVED 2026-09-04, and the names above now carry the answer.
 * These two addresses used to be declared here as GLB_LF_CFG "L3FE ingress-FIFO
 * thresholds" (0x30b4) and GLB_ILPB_00 "ingress-loopback VLAN config" (0x30bc).
 * Both were wrong, and the tree already said so twice: this note, and the
 * 2026-07-25 correction in cortina-ni-flowoffload.c, each derived from stock's
 * own accessor names (aal_l3fe_glb_cls_stg_monitor_get / _dbg_get).  The vendor
 * NAME->ADDRESS table shipped in the stock rootfs (etc/reg.txt) is a SECOND,
 * independent tier-2 derivation and agrees exactly: 0x30b4 is
 * L3FE_GLB_CLS_STG_MONITOR_RETURN and 0x30bc is L3FE_GLB_DBG_DAT.  Two tiers
 * agreeing is the bar, so the names are corrected rather than merely doubted.
 * The pair also corroborates itself: 0x30b0 is the CLS monitor CTRL, so 0x30b4
 * being its RETURN is the ordinary control/data pairing, and 0x30b8/0x30bc are
 * the matching DBG index/data pair.
 *
 * ★ WHAT IS *NOT* RESOLVED: cortina_ni_rx_l3fe_glb_init() still WRITES both, and
 * a write to a read-data port is INERT -- so the claim that the "LF_CFG
 * thresholds" unblocked the L3FE ingress FIFO remains a false attribution, and
 * whatever really unblocked it is still unidentified.  The writes are left in
 * place deliberately: they are on the shipping-proven boot path and no board can
 * be booted to test their removal while the bench relay is dead.  Removing them
 * is owed work, gated on a live read.  The offload backend's own copies of these
 * offsets (CN_L3E_GLB_DBG_IDX/DAT and CN_L3E_GLB_LATCH_*) only ever READ them.
